# 🌍 Geographic Information RAG with Spatial Queries

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to handle **geographic and spatial queries** using natural language input. The system integrates geographic data, location-based context, and satellite-related metadata (demo) to provide informative responses.

## 🚀 Live Demo

👉 [Click here to open the deployed app](https://geographic-information-rag-with-spatial-queries-aitmn8khofxuga.streamlit.app)

> ⚠️ _Note: Currently running in **demo mode**. Full backend with satellite imagery and vector-based retrieval is under development._

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Clean user interface for spatial queries
- ✅ Accepts location/place names as input
- ✅ Simulated geographic document retrieval
- ✅ Displays coordinates and spatial descriptions
- ⚠️ Placeholder/demo results for testing the interface flow

---

## 🧠 Planned Features (Coming Soon)

- 🌐 Vector database integration (ChromaDB or FAISS)
- 🌍 Embeddings with Sentence Transformers
- 🛰️ Satellite imagery metadata processing
- 🗺️ Geospatial data indexing and retrieval
- 🧾 Context-aware RAG responses
