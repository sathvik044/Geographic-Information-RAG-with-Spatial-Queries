# üöÄ Public Deployment Instructions

## For Project Submission - Public Link Required

Your Geographic Information RAG System needs to be publicly accessible. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

## Option 1: Streamlit Cloud (Recommended - Free)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
1. Make sure all your files are committed to Git
2. Push to GitHub if not already done

### Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository**: Your GitHub repo name
   - **Branch**: main (or master)
   - **Main file path**: `app.py`
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Get Your Public Link
- Your app will be available at: `https://your-app-name-your-username.streamlit.app`
- This is your **public link** for submission

## üîß Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### If you get "Error installing requirements":

**Option A: Use the fallback app**
1. In Streamlit Cloud, change the main file path to: `app-fallback.py`
2. This version works with minimal dependencies

**Option B: Use simplified requirements**
1. Rename `requirements-cloud.txt` to `requirements.txt`
2. This removes problematic geospatial dependencies

**Option C: Manual dependency fix**
1. Go to "Manage App" in Streamlit Cloud
2. Check the terminal logs for specific error messages
3. Common issues:
   - GDAL/geospatial libraries not available
   - Memory limits exceeded
   - Python version conflicts

### Alternative: Hugging Face Spaces (More Reliable)

If Streamlit Cloud continues to have issues:

1. Go to [huggingface.co/spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
2. Click "Create new Space"
3. Choose settings:
   - **Owner**: Your username
   - **Space name**: geograph-rag
   - **License**: MIT
   - **SDK**: Streamlit
   - **Python version**: 3.9
4. Upload your files
5. Use `app-fallback.py` as the main file

## Files Ready for Deployment

‚úÖ **All necessary files are prepared:**
- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application (with error handling)
- `app-fallback.py` - Fallback demo version (minimal dependencies)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `requirements-cloud.txt` - Simplified dependencies
- `packages.txt` - System dependencies
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] Repository pushed to GitHub
- [ ] App deployed to Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face
- [ ] Public link working and accessible
- [ ] All features functional in deployed version
- [ ] README updated with deployment link

## Quick Test Commands

After deployment, test these features:
1. **Home page** loads correctly
2. **Spatial queries** work (try: "What cities are near New York?")
3. **System statistics** display properly
4. **Navigation** between pages works

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the deployment logs
2. Try the fallback app (`app-fallback.py`)
3. Use simplified requirements (`requirements-cloud.txt`)
4. Consider Hugging Face Spaces as alternative
5. Test locally first with `streamlit run app.py`
